	The Turkey Run Park gate is shut at 7:15am on Saturday morning, so Mary Ewell and I drive to the endpoint of the Potomac Heritage Trail (mile 10) on Live Oak Dr. We amble for 77 minutes downstream to the signpost at the end of the woods within sight of Route 123, and then take 77 minutes to go upstream, averaging just under 18 min/mi assuming we went the official 8.6 miles --- but I think we go a little faster than that, and a little farther.

We run south on the Cabin John Trail, 79 minutes out and 80 minutes back. Along the way we see four chipmunks //(or two chipmunks twice each?)// and scare a doe in the brush as we approach Seven Locks Rd after crossing River Rd //(Caren says, "Sorry, deer!")//.
