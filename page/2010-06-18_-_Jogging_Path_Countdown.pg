	Orb spider's huge web glints in the morning sunrise; tiny bunny hops away from the trail; mangy deer nibbles the grass. I'm running on the woodsy path near work, taking advantage of unusually cool weather, trying another experiment in accelerating pace. Marked miles, accuracy unknown, say 10:06 (holding back), 9:40 (comfy), 8:45 (brisk), and 7:38 (pushing hard). Right knee still feels twinges, and the right quadriceps has odd moments of weakness.
