	Sunbeams sparkle from dewdrops clinging to the tips of pine needles. Worms like vermicelli decorate the wet asphalt pathway. Blonde ponytail beckons as its owner walks up a hill, then starts running again. I give chase. "Good day!" and "Great run!" bless each other's efforts. She turns toward the office as I begin a second circuit. Pace on marked miles descends 10.0 &rArr; 9.4 &rArr; 8.4 &rArr; 7.6 min/mi, heart pounding 180+ pulse after final sprint, witnessed by deer and her speckled fawn.
