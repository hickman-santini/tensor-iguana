	A big brown groundhog humps off the trailside as I approach. Nobody tells me that the air quality today is Code Orange, but soon enough after I start, about 4pm from Reston near the corner of Wiehle and Sunrise Valley, the heat and humidity start cooking my goose. Within a few miles I'm well-done. It's a bit over a mile to the W&OD Trail, and from milepost 15.5 the first three miles are 9:51 + 10:20 + 10:31. I drink down my water supply and stop at the Trolley fountain in Vienna to refill and take an S! e-cap.
