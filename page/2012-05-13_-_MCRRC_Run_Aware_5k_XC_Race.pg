	In the last quarter mile of the MCRRC "Run Aware" 5k cross-country race I catch up with a little girl and, pushing hard, manage to pass her. I feel a little bad about that. But all guilt is soon erased when, finish line in sight, she puts on a burst of speed and sprints by like a rocket. It's 10-year-old Gabriella Ro Capizzi, who comes in 5 full seconds ahead of me. //What a kick!//
	
	Since 9pm last night I haven't eaten anything, and I've only drunk water. This morning I'm scheduled to get some blood drawn for testing, in preparation for a routine physical exam. After the race I chat with speedy runner John Way and mention my excuse for my pitiful performance. "That's ironic!" John says. "FASTing makes you SLOWer!"
	
	Today's run goes well, and afterwards I accompany Caren Jew for some extra mileage along the Cabin John Stream Valley Trail. Son [[http://packbat.net/wiki|Robin]] gets up early and joins me in the race. At my advice he trots along with Caren, and that pace-control strategy results in a good result in his first cross-country race.
