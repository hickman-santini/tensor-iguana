	* It was fortuitous to have been wandering around in the [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki?action=admin Administration] page.
	* It was fortuitous to have enough ADD to have decided to explore the [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki?action=index Index of All Pages] link on the  Administration page.   
	* Among the 4953 pages listed, it was helpful to have had the sense (?) to wander around among the entries that begin with //Wiki..// where I stumbled upon the [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/WikiQuickStart WikiQuickStart] page. The [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/Help Help] page makes no reference to the helpful WikiQuickStart page, presumably because the former is concerned   mostly with intra-page issues.
	* Eureka, there's an **Add a Page** list item in that QuickStart page.
	* That list item suggests //.. make a tiny comment, sign it by juxtaposing your first name and last name ..//.  There is some rule of thumb in interface design, that no matter how reasonable and straight-forward is a bit of advice to the user, s/he will do something surprisingly stupid. Well, maybe I'm being too hard on myself, because, after all, the first entries in the SandBox that are clearly not the work of the The Man Behind The Curtain are annotated "By Ririan", and maybe considering that to be a //signature// is not completely wacky.  Suffice it to say that by a process of elimination, I eventually concluded that "sign it" meant putting my name in the UserName box. 
	* Since the **Add a Page** item mentions that we'll need an "unfulfilled link", it seemed like a good idea to leave a link to my new page within the "tiny comment" I used as part of the creation process.  What appears to work for that is to insert syntax of the form {{{[[url label]]}}}, and not the form {{{[url label]}}} described under **Markup Syntax** in the [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/Help Help ] page. 
	* The "unfulfilled link" and other advice given on the QuickStart page to juxtapose first and last names, taken together with the "Put two or more capitalized words together to get a WikiWord" mentioned in the [http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/WikiWord WikiWord] seemed to imply that a WikiWord, e.g. {{{ThisAndThat}}}, will be recognized as a reference to {{{http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/ThisAndThat}}} in some contexts. So far, the only such context appears to be an unrecognized {{{UserName}}}. 
	* Having added a page wherein a critical step was signing a comment with an unrecognized UserName, believe it or not, it still wasn't quite clear what might be different when adding a new page called something else.  Clearly it had to do with using an "unfulfilled link" and WikiWords.
