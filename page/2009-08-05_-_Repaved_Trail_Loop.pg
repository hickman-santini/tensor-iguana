	Two spotted fawns stare at me and then bolt for cover as I applaud them. The pathway through the woods near the office was closed for many weeks but is open again, newly surfaced and smoother, but just as hilly. For a warm and humid afternoon the marked miles go by surprisingly well, at 9:41, 8:44, and a final blitz of 7:49 before I stagger back to work. In the evening Christina Caravoulias and I walk up and down the Mormon Temple hill three times, at 17-18 min/mi pace. Chris spots a large bunny nibbling the grass, and as dusk sets in the fireflies come out to wink at us.
