	The morning is humid and though our pace is slow I'm soon dripping sweat. Clair is getting back into running and I'm recovering from mysterious shin twinges so we walk the hills of the paved forest path and enjoy the morning break from the office grind. It's a happy chatty trek: we talk about personal stuff, share secrets, gossip, and marvel at the day. Our quantitative personalities similarly enjoy doing quantitative experiments on our respective selves. No deer or rabbits seen&mdash;maybe the sun is too bright?
