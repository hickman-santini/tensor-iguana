	"Co-enablers in cold craziness!" Peer pressure combined with early morning meetings and stiff northerly breezes plus temps in the upper 20s make for a short Dawn Patrol ramble. Before lips go totally numb we catch up on weekend family news and mourn the passing of David Bowie. Kerry mentions the film **The Linguini Incident** in which he stars; her college roommate was involved in producing it. Other performances are saluted: **The Prestige**, **Labyrinth**, and **Into the Night**. Icy patches alternate with muddy puddles. A meteor streaks overhead &mdash; perhaps a late Quadrantid, perhaps Sir David checking that we're ok.
	
	From the song "Let's Dance":
