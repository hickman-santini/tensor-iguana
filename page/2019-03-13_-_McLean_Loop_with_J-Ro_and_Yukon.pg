	"Maybe he hasn't had his coffee yet?" We speculate as to why a driver expresses annoyance at J-Ro for running in the street, his super-reflective jacket glittering in headlights. Yukon risks the sidewalk, roiled by tree roots; Roadkill takes the middle path, a grassy median. There's room for all. Temps hover in the upper 20s.
	
	"You're on a slippery slope!" Roadkill warns of the looming temptation to run ultras. We trot around the neighborhood, walking the hills and enjoying the quiet. Venus hangs low in the east. Mademoiselle, a Runkeeper GPS voice, says "Oooh la la" a bit too often.
