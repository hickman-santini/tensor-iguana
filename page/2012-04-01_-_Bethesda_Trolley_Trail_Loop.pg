	Happy April Fools Day from my GPS! The [[http://connect.garmin.com/activity/163889806|trackfile]] shows how things go wacky as I emerge from the Capital Crescent Trail tunnel under Wisconsin Avenue in downtown Bethesda: as satellites are re-acquired there's a big glitch in estimated position. I definitely did **//not//** run a sub-8 minute mile there.
	
	For years I've tried to do the entire [[http://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/dot-dte/common/standards/BTT_Broch_text_finalproof.pdf|Bethesda Trolley Trail]] but never properly found either official end of the path.
