	| http://zhurnaly.com/images/running/fall_down_run_2014-11-24_z.jpg | Ridiculously warm weather with just traces of light drizzle: Kerry & I set out to get a drink at the W&OD water fountain, but when we arrive our hopes are dashed &mdash; it's turned off, as is the tap on the side for dogs. We pause at a convenience store on Route 7 and Kerry buys bottled water.
