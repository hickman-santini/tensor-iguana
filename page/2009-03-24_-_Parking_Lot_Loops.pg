	Meetings finish a bit after 2pm so before anything else I rush to change clothes and get a few miles in: three clockwise laps around the office complex streets. I encounter only a few walkers and one fellow runner who's heading in the opposite direction, a young lady well bundled-up against the cool (~47&deg;) air. It's sunny, light winds, and the 1.5 mile circuits take 13:56 + 13:51 + 13:14 each.
