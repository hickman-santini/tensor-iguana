	<div class="old"><p>&lt; === <strong class="changes">21+</strong> miles @ ~<strong class="changes">15</strong> min/mi<br />&lt; <strong class="changes">Ed Schultze has organized another training run along his beloved Seneca Creek Greenway Trail, and C-C, Ken, and I decide to try it.</strong> At <strong class="changes">7</strong>:<strong class="changes">25am when</strong> Ken <strong class="changes">and I arrive at the MD355 trailhead the parking lot [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q</strong>&amp;<strong class="changes">hl=en&amp;q=39%C2%B0+10.042%27N+77%C2%B0+13.744%27W&amp;ll=39.167369,-77.229059&amp;spn=0.008285,0.016973] is almost full. C-C climbs into the back of Paulette's MINI Cooper, as does ultrarunner Pete, who tells us about some</strong> of <strong class="changes">his adventures during</strong> the <strong class="changes">drive to Damascus Recreational Park [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q</strong>&amp;<strong class="changes">hl=en</strong>&amp;<strong class="changes">q=39%C2%B0+14.816%27N+77%C2%B0+13.435%27W] where the day's journey begins. We leave early, planning to go at our own slow pace</strong> and <strong class="changes">preparing to be passed by speedier runners. //(But during our jog Ken offers the zen-like riddle: if you're never passed, then are you the **fastest** or the **slowest**?)//<br />&lt; The air temperature is at freezing, so we layer on the clothes. We walk for a few minutes to warm</strong> up<strong class="changes">, then jog down the paved pathway</strong> to <strong class="changes">the beginning</strong> of the <strong class="changes">Magruder Branch Trail [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=39%C2%B0+15.132%27N+77%C2%B0+12.780%27W&amp;ll=39.252195,-77.213008&amp;spn=0.008275,0.016973]. Blue blazes are so abundant that we never get significantly off-course. A few miles into</strong> the <strong class="changes">trip people running upstream meet us, and a bit later those heading downstream begin to catch up and zip by. A herd</strong> of <strong class="changes">whitetail deer leap through</strong> the <strong class="changes">brush on both sides and then cross the trail just in front of us. Their tails are amazingly fluffy, like featherdusters. Does this portend a hard winter ahead?<br />&lt; Our progress is steady; psychological pressure from my companions' presence keeps me moving a bit faster than I probably would have gone alone</strong>. We <strong class="changes">take walk-breaks on hills and as we get tired. Banter between Ken</strong> and <strong class="changes">me keeps C-C amused. After several uneventful water crossings earlier</strong> in the <strong class="changes">day</strong>, with <strong class="changes">only a mile</strong> to <strong class="changes">go at a small tributary stream C-C's foot slips off a stepping-stone</strong> and <strong class="changes">she get wet up to the ankle</strong>. <strong class="changes">"You're trail</strong>-<strong class="changes">baptized now!" I remark. As the MD355 parking lot comes into sight C-C sprints</strong> up <strong class="changes">the hill</strong> in <strong class="changes">a strong finish. My GPS measures</strong> the <strong class="changes">distance</strong> as <strong class="changes">10</strong>.<strong class="changes">6+ miles, but since it's usually low by ~5% for winding routes I suspect that</strong> the <strong class="changes">actual path we took is ~~11 miles, at an average pace</strong> of <strong class="changes">~14:30 min/mi, including ~5 minutes</strong> we <strong class="changes">stopped</strong> to <strong class="changes">eat and drink along</strong> the <strong class="changes">way.<br />&lt; We eat, drink,</strong> and <strong class="changes">chat with fellow runners for several minutes. Then, as planned, I refill my water bottle and begin the return trip to Damascus where I left the car. That journey is marked by much more mud, since temperatures have now risen into</strong> the <strong class="changes">50's and frozen bogs have melted wherever they're not well-shaded. I spy a few more large fluffy-tailed deer</strong>, <strong class="changes">including one big buck with a well-developed three-point rack. He turns his head</strong> to <strong class="changes">eye me until</strong> the <strong class="changes">trail takes me out of sight. After three hours hoof time I'm sweating enough to take an electrolyte capsule and remove my outer shirt. An hour later when I look for my tin of caps to take another I can't find them</strong>; <strong class="changes">I must have dropped</strong> the <strong class="changes">little box and not noticed. I eat a Cliff "Builder's Bar" and console myself by reading</strong> the <strong class="changes">wrapper, which implies that it contains enough sodium and potassium to meet my needs</strong>.<br />&lt; <strong class="changes">With five miles to go</strong> I<strong class="changes">'m walking a lot now, and who should I see striding briskly toward me but Comrade **Way-No**! His broken foot continues</strong> to <strong class="changes">heal nicely, he reports. He warns me that the Magruder Branch Trail takes</strong> some <strong class="changes">tricky turns and is easy to lose heading upstream. Appropriately cautioned, I turn</strong> on the <strong class="changes">GPS map display for the track I recorded during</strong> the <strong class="changes">downstream trip and thereafter</strong> have <strong class="changes">no problems following it back to the parking lot. A few young runners are waiting there and I beg a drink of water from them, since my supply ran out half an hour earlier</strong>. <strong class="changes">The GPS measures the round trip as 21.23 miles, again likely a few percent low. I took about 10 minutes longer to get back solo, for a net overall</strong> pace <strong class="changes">of ~~15 min/mi. The odyssey ends with no blisters and no chafing, but</strong> the <strong class="changes">soles of my feet feel a bit bruised. My bright new trail shoes emerge with a legitimate layer of dried mud</strong>.</p></div><p><strong>to</strong></p>
