	How to get my weight and blood pressure down a bit for this afternoon's doctor's appointment? How to make sure my aching right knee and left metatarsals are at full throb, in case that helps the diagnosis? Obviously, go out for a run an hour or two before! And where else to test the new GPS than on the classic "Purple Line", the little violet-blazed trail that runs down one side of Rock Creek and back up the other not far from my home.
