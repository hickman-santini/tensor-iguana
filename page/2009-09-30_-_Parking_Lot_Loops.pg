	"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" plays on the loudspeakers in the gym as I suit up and head outside. Clouds promise rain during my first lap around the parking perimeter. It's a cool day with brisk westerly winds. Holding back somewhat the first ~1.5 mile circuit is at ~9.3 min/mi. During the second the gusts begin, followed by a light shower that would be chilly if I weren't running. I accelerate to a fast-but-comfortable ~8.7 min/mi. Halfway around I overtake a chunky tattooed guy chugging along. "Great day, isn't it? You're moving good!" I tell him. The final lap, pushing hard, is a brisk 7.8 min/mi. The rain stops as I finish.
