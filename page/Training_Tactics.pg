text: The article "Running on the Shoulders of Giants" by Scott Douglas offers half a dozen interesting ideas for better training. It appears in the January/February 2009 issue of //Running Times//, a magazine that Ken Swab passed along to me. Douglas's suggestions:
	* **"Vary Great"** - train at a wider variety of paces from day to day; make the hard days harder and the easy days easier, by multiple minutes/mile
	* **"Start Slow, Finish Fast"** - vary the pace during an outing, again by many min/mi, and finish strong
	* **"Work the Recovery"** - eat and drink appropriately right after a training run, to restore electrolytes and nutrients
	* **"Drill, Baby, Drill"** - do range-of-motion and dynamic stretching exercises as part of the workout
	* **"Warm Up Aggressively"** - spend more time and effort warming up, especially before a big race
	* **"Be a Reality-Based Optimist"** - have faith in yourself
	
	That last point is perhaps the most significant. As Douglas says, elite runners:
	"""
	... have confidence that great things will happen if they do the right work. They see a fabulous workout or race as a hint of what they can achieve, not a unique occurrence.

	Marvelous advice, obviously applicable throughout life!
