She's at mile 81.5 of a 101 mile race. Her legs are worn out from slipping on sheets of ice and layers of mud, clambering over roots and rocks, falling down and standing up again, tip-toeing across streams, scrambling up hills and descending into valleys. She's racing the clock and has just made the crucial 24-hour cutoff &mdash; but only by 30 minutes. No sleep since 3am the day before. Tummy trouble from chugging energy drinks to stay awake. Dashing through Aid Station checkpoints, constantly pushing the pace. No time to waste if she's going to finish within the final 32 hour limit.<br /><br /><em><strong>"Of course!"</strong></em> I reply. "Give me five minutes to get ready. And &mdash; thank you for asking."<br /><br />Saturday evening I drop out of the race after taking ~12.5 hours to cover 42 miles, the first two laps of five. I hang around to help at an aid station, applaud runners as they head out, and commiserate with those who, like me, DNF <em>(Did Not Finish)</em>. At ~1am on Sunday I give ultra-buddy John Hord a ride homeward, and return at ~3am to nap in front of the fire for a few fitful hours.

The elements do their best, but nonetheless ~70% of the 100k runners and ~40% of the 100 milers finish.<br /><br />In a midnight conversation Race Director Toni Aurilio explains the title "Devil Dog" <em>(her husband is a Marine &mdash; "Not a <strong>retired</strong> Marine", I correct her &mdash; "he's always a <strong>Marine</strong>!")</em> and the Aid Station names: "Toofy" is the nickname of her family's "Teufel Hund" <em>("Devil Dog" in German)</em>, "Gunny" is Toofy's brother <em>(and the nickname of every Marine gunnery sergeant)</em>, and "Remi" was the mother of both, who sadly died a year ago. Oh, and there are "Devil Dog" creme-filled devils-food cakes at the aid stations. <em>Yummy!</em><br /><br />How did we get here?
