	"You have great calf definition!" I compliment one of my fellow runners. Maybe it's genetic; I certainly don't get that kind of muscle visibility. At 2:45pm I pick up Gayatri at her home and we zip down Democracy Blvd to park at the nature center on Cabin John Trail. We're 5 minutes early and, as expected, Caren appears within seconds. We gear up and trot north on the CJSVT. Caren sets an aggressive pace, with Gayatri and I trailing behind her. At Tuckerman Lane I tag the street. Our loop back via the parking lot is uneventful.
