	"DEET-Man!" Insect repellent is the potion-of-the-day at the fourth annual "Ran It with Janet" 50k. Every year the trails in Manassas National Battlefield Park get more lovely, with their turtles and thistles, snakes and millipedes, butterflies and dragonflies. Race organizers and volunteers are enthusiastic and helpful. What's not to love? Overall winner Mariska Kramer flies past, miles ahead of everybody else. What a day!
	
	Bull Run's greatest challenges this year are heat and humidity, as forecast heavy rains fail to materialize, clouds are intermittent, breezes weak and sporadic. Laps decelerate: ~2.5 --> ~2.7 --> ~2.8 hours. Hydration and electrolyte management are essential. Dr Merle magically materializes midrace with an icy drink. (Thank you, Sir!)
