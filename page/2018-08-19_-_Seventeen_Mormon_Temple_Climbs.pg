	| More important than speed or strength is **patience** - so on a warm Sunday morning, try 17 repeats of the nearby Mormon Temple Hill. It's about a 6% grade and nearly a mile round-trip, so GPS trackfile markers stack up in a heap. For pace control run uphill on the prime numbers //(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...)// and walk the climb on the composites. Trot back down, chug Gatorade, and do it again.
