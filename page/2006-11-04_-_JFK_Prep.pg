	As Bernie (aka Lisa) and I trek along the Appalachian Trail an older gentleman passes us. His name is Paul Betker and he tells us that this year will be his 25th consecutive running of the JFK 50 Miler. We are impressed; we're preparing for our first JFK attempt. Judging by the icicles on my beard the temperatures are in the mid-20's (&deg;F) this morning. The sun is mostly up and the leaves are mostly down when we set off from the [[http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.484477+-77.620071&z=13&t=h| Old South Mountain Inn ]], a 250-year-old establishment at Turner's Gap in the hills of western Maryland.
