	The Road Runners Club of America sponsors friendly competitions among member organizations, so when Emaad Burki & Cara Marie Manlandro offer me a free ride to/from today's race I can hardly resist a chance to canter with friends and support the MCRRC&mdash;especially when the weather forecast suggests snow //(whee!)//. Emaad's GPS brings us early to Howard County Community College in Columbia MD where we pick up bibs and visit with comrades Wayne Carson, Jeanne Larrison, and Christina Caravoulias. Walking to the start I scan the crowds for Caren Jew. I find her just in time at the back of the pack after her pre-race ramble to log some extra distance. It's been far too long since Caren and I have had a chance to trot along together, so today is a treat. It's also good training for me after yesterday's trail excursion.
