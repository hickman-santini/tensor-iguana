	| http://zhurnaly.com/images/running/Seneca_Slopes_2013_course_map.jpg | Brrrrrrr! Snow flurries begin as the Seneca Slopes XC race is about to start. It's a hilly trek through the woods, over rocks, roots, and a few muddy swales. At mile 4 I slip and fall; fellow runners pause to check but I'm ok and wave them on as I stagger to my feet, check knee and hand but only find slight scrapes, pick up my cap, and carry on with a loss of only a few seconds.
	
	Arch-nemesis 6-year-old Jason Parks beats me handily today, by more than a minute, as the [[http://www.mcrrc.org/seneca-slopes-9k-0|official results]] list me first of seven in the 60-64 year old male cohort, 57th place overall behind 48 men and 8 women, with 153 total finishers.
	
	The [[http://connect.garmin.com/activity/413620647|Garmin]] GPS and iPhone [[http://runkeeper.com/user/zhurnaly/activity/278784809|Runkeeper]] roughly concur on route and pace. |
	
	| http://zhurnaly.com/images/running/Seneca_Slopes_z1_by_nguyen.jpg | Approximate splits from the Garmin: 9:01 + 9:18 + 9:42 + 9:34 + 9:18 + final fraction kicking it in at 8:39 min/mi pace.
	
	Many thanks to kind friend Barry Smith for driving me to/from the race!
