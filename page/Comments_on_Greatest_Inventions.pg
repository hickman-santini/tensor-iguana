	Thank you very much!
	
	Smolin's remarks made me interested in seeing if I could learn something about category theory, and by accidentally searching YouTube instead of Google or Wikipedia I stumbled over [http://youtu.be/ZKmodCApZwk the beginning of a lecture series by Steve Awodey from the University of Oregon for computer scientists on the subject.] I think the main thing I learned was that I don't have the background to understand it, sadly (I would love to be able to produce [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense general abstract nonsense]), but I understood enough to be amused by this, after the 56 minute mark: in the course of discussing the philosophical unease that one might feel about categories of categories, Awodey wrote:
	"""

	on the whiteboard, and a student asked him to write it larger. He said, "Here", extended the line to read:
	"""
	`g{Fix some foundations}
	"""
	and told the class, "...make this large...."
