	This story is all about how to think less.
	
	Less, but better.
	
	It's all quite easy &mdash; at least, easy in the telling. Not so easy in the doing, though, because while //thinking// you also have to remember to //think **about** your own thinking//. It's as if you climb up a ladder and look down at yourself and watch what you're doing. Then you can give yourself hints on how to do it more precisely, faster, with less work and fewer mistakes, so you come out with a better result.
	
	The language in this book is pretty simple, so you can read it to your sisters or brothers //(or your parents or kids)// and they can understand it //(maybe!)//.

If something here doesn't make sense to you, then maybe the authors haven't understood it well enough to explain it properly. Once you figure it out, please write us a letter so we can do better in a future edition.
	
	Shall we begin? 
	
	
	== Who's Here?
	
	Every story needs to have characters. Ours has three main ones. They help each other figure stuff out, fix each other's mistakes, and explain things to each other. You may really like one of them or really hate one of them, but please try to give each of them a chance. They're different, and sometimes different is good!
	
	* //**Sneg**// &mdash; who asks questions and sees problems everywhere, and who is really great at finding reasons why something **won't** work //("Sneg" means "Snow" in Russian)//
	
	* //**Ogon**// &mdash; who thinks fast and offers lots of ideas, but who doesn't always stick with them long enough to make them work, and who sometimes doesn't have much luck separating good plans from silly ones //("Ogon" means "Fire" in Russian)//
	
	* //**Grunt**// &mdash; who goes slowly and steadily, likes to check all the details along the way, and tries to make sure there are no errors or exceptions //("Grunt" means "Earth" in Russian)//
	
	
	== What's the Plan?
	
	This book begins with some of the easiest tricks for thinking less, better. //(Or maybe they're the hardest tricks? &mdash; since knowing the difference between **easy** and **hard** is a **super-hard** trick!)// The story builds toward more complicated tricks. //(Again, maybe!)//
	
	But you can read the chapters of this book in any order you like. In fact, it's best to read them in the order that makes most sense to you. That's probably //not// the order they're arranged in, by the way.

	=== The Game of Truth
	
	"What's the simplest thing to think about?" Sneg asked one day.
	
	"Nothing!" said Grunt, and went back to digging a hole.
	
	"Everything!" said Ogon. "There's stars, and where do they go to when the sun comes up? And there are jokes &mdash; why are some of them funny and others not? And then there's the wind, and where babies come from, and which fork to use for ..."
	
	"No," interrupted Sneg. "I mean **really** simple. Like, so simple you couldn't think about anything less and still have anything to think about."
	
	"Nothing!" said Grunt again, and kept digging.
	
	"Thank you, Grunt, but 'nothing' is just too simple. If all you have is 'nothing', here's no place to go from there," said Sneg.
	
	"So how about just two things: 'something' as opposed to 'nothing?" asked Ogon.
