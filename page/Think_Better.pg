The simplest and best way to do this is to think about how unlikely -- how surprising -- the new information is. If it's totally expected, then your previous beliefs don't need to change much. If it's an extraordinary surprise, then that's important new evidence that something is different.</p><p>For instance, suppose you watch somebody tossing a coin. It comes up "heads" every time, ten times in a row. That's pretty unusual -- about one chance in a thousand. You begin to suspect that this is a two-headed trick coin. Every toss you see that comes up "heads" increases the likelihood that it's a trick coin. After another ten "heads" in a row, that's another factor of a thousand or so. You begin to expect every toss to come up the same from now on, and the confirmation of that has an ever-decreasing effect on your beliefs.</p><p>But now, if the coin EVER comes up "tails" that's a HUGE surprise!

	Tools to think better aren't hard; they're easier than being sloppy, once one gets used to them. At first, though, some feel strange, exotic, especially in their abstraction. They //**transcend**// &mdash; they level-up, to higher planes where horizons recede and entire landscapes suddenly are sharp, where a single step crosses whole continents or even galaxies.

	* don't cling to past judgments
	* analyze &mdash; break things down to fundamentals, go deep, seek fundamental principles
	
	=== - &xrarr; Change &xrarr; //**Be Soft**//
	* //(almost!)// never be certain
	* see //(most!)// things as continuous ranges of //maybe//, not true-or-false dualities &mdash; like knobs, not switches
	* tune &mdash; adjust estimated likelihoods of beliefs, up or down, as information comes in, based on the strength of new evidence as compared to the weight of prior knowledge //(generally!)//

	== Three Things
	
	| //** Open:
	... to See
	... to Doubt
	... to Love **// |
	
	Three aspects of //** Openness **//:
	* Mindfulness - open to new viewpoints - ready and eager to view things from different directions and scales, zooming out or in, abstracting and particularizing - awake and aware and paying attention
	* Nonattachment - open to change - skeptical, full of doubt, nuanced, not-clinging, ready and eager to vary the strength of all beliefs as new evidence comes in or further thinking suggests the need to alter
	* Oneness - open to connect - realizing the unity of all things - nonduality in spite of differences - 1 = Yin+Yang - "[[Mantra - No Others|There Are No Others]]" ...
	
	
	... other fragments/forms to consider:
	
	| //** Meta
	Doubt
	Nonduality **// |
	
	* //** Meta **// - abstract, transcend, zoom, rename, ... - 0 - Mindfulness
	* //** Doubt **// - bayesianism, fallibilism, pragmatism, ... - &mdash; - Nonattachment
	* //** Nonduality **// - invert, conjugate, converse, complement, ... - 0 - Oneness
	
	
	To think better, there are three big things to remember:
	* Belief is a knob, not a switch &mdash; be open to uncertainty and aware of the amount of doubt in every judgment
	* Weigh the evidence &mdash; be open to new information, don't cling to past conclusions but also don't discard them prematurely
	* Use the sharpest tools &mdash; be open to learning new ways of thinking, but make them the most powerful ones available
	
	The rest of this book is expanding those three things; if you have to stop now, you've got the key point already.
	
	Note in all of the above the key word is //**open**// &mdash; a key psychological characteristic, and a key concept ...
	
	//how about other trios?//
	* mindfulness-nonattachment-oneness ...
	* nothingness-change-universality ...
	* earth-water-air ... solid-liquid-gas ... matter-life-spacetime ...
	
	How to decide wisely, when the future is foggy and you don't have compete information? How to avoid getting cheated? How to help those you care about make better choices? How to reward good behavior, not just luck?
	
	The real world is full of foggy situations ...
	
	Toy problems aren't enough...
	
	False precision is like quicksand: people struggle to design an accurate model, wrestle with solving it, and then take its "answers" far too seriously &mdash; and ignore the //**big elephants**// that it has left out &mdash; the wrong assumptions, especially the possibility that something completely different might happen. ...
	
	
	== Believe in Knobs, not Switches
	
	| //** Beliefs are knobs, not switches. **// |
	
	Outside of definitions and math (and even within much math) there are degrees of certainty, odds and likelihoods, ranges of numbers rather than specific answers, errors distributed across a zone, a universe of multiple possibilities.
	
	When new information comes in &mdash; evidence &mdash; it's vital to update beliefs rather than throw them away. "Turn the Knob", more or less, based on the balance between the weight of prior knowledge and the strength of new data. That's Bayes Theorem, in a qualitative nutshell.
	
	Mostly in words:
	* Consider how strong a belief is &mdash; "unlikely" //(e.g., one chance in a million that it's true, one chance in a thousand, one chance in ten)// vs "maybe" //(e.g., "50-50" more or less)// vs "likely" //(e.g., nine times out of ten, 999 out of a thousand, one chance in a million that it's false)//. Then consider how strong a new piece of evidence is that the belief should or shouldn't change. "Strong" new evidence for something isn't redundant with what you already know and wouldn't often be seen if the belief isn't true. "Weak" new evidence overlaps past experience, or could plausibly occur whether or not the belief is correct. ...
	
	<<see "Weigh the Evidence" below?!>>
	
	Mostly in numbers:
	* Assign odds to a belief &mdash; ... <<Bayes Rule!>> ...
	
	| //**before**// * //**likelihood**// = //**after**// |
	
	Or, as a bumper sticker "mantra":
	| //** Don't be too sure! **// |
	
	A famous quote about updating beliefs, attributed in various versions to the economist John Maynard Keynes: "When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?" or more pithily but less-accurately "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"

	=== Weigh the Evidence
	
	When new information comes it, you need to update your prior beliefs. The simplest and best way to do this is to think about how unlikely -- how surprising -- the new information is. If it's totally expected, then your previous beliefs don't need to change much. If it's an extraordinary surprise, then that's important new evidence that something is different.
	
	For instance, suppose you watch somebody tossing a coin. It comes up "heads" every time, ten times in a row. That's pretty unusual -- about one chance in a thousand. You begin to suspect that this is a two-headed trick coin. Every toss you see that comes up "heads" increases the likelihood that it's a trick coin. After another ten "heads" in a row, that's another factor of a thousand or so. You begin to expect every toss to come up the same from now on, and the confirmation of that has an ever-decreasing effect on your beliefs.
	
	But now, if the coin EVER comes up "tails" that's a HUGE surprise! It refutes the belief that it's a two-headed coin. ...

	A good thinker must navigate between two different types of bias //(scylla and charybdis!)//:
	* //**anchoring**// - clinging to old beliefs too firmly, not changing one's judgments enough when strong new evidence comes in
	* //**flightiness**// - leaping to new beliefs too quickly, based on the latest information without regard to the weight of established information
	
	...
	
	
	== Use the Sharpest Tools
	
	Besides bayesian probability, better thinking happens with quantitative tools including:
	
	=== Statistics
	
	
	think **square root of N** ~ **deviation** ... concepts of "normal distribution" and "mean" vs "median" versus "mode" ...
	
	| &radic;N |
	
	How likely is something? That's often easy to estimate. Toss a thousand coins and on the average get about 500 heads, sure. But //**exactly**// 500? That's not at all likely! What range is it reasonable to expect?
	
	A great rule of thumb: "plus or minus the square root of N", where "N" is how many things you're expecting to see ...
	
	... see [[Normal Distribution]]
	
	
	=== Game Theory
	
	think "pure strategy" and **minimax** and **mixed strategy** and **two-person zero-sum** etc. //(see John Williams **The Compleat Strategyst**)//
	
	| |= Rock |= Paper |= Scissors |
	|= Rock | 0 | -1 | +1 |
	|= Paper | +1 | 0 | -1 |
	|= Scissors | -1 | +1 | 0 |
	
	=== Web of Information
	
	think **networks** of evidence and and graphs
	
	=== Log Odds
	
	from [[https://arbital.com/p/bayes_log_odds/|Bayes' rule: Log-odds form - Arbital]]
	"""
	The odds form of Bayes's Rule states that the prior odds times the likelihood ratio equals the posterior odds. We can take the log of both sides of this equation, yielding an equivalent equation which uses addition instead of multiplication.

	and from [[ThinkingToolsGoals]] //(preface to **Simply Scheme** by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright)//
	"""
	... Computer programs have become too large and complex to encompass in a human mind. Therefore, the job of computer science education is to teach people how to expand their minds so that the programs can fit, by learning to think in a vocabulary of larger, more powerful, more flexible ideas than the obvious ones. Each unit of programming thought must have a big payoff in the capabilities of the program. ...
