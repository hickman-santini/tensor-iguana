	The lawn sprinkler beside the sidewalk is like a tiny oasis as I run through its mist. I'm on my way toward Langley High, today from the west: a friend leaves work early and gives me a ride to the corner of Balls Hill Rd and Georgetown Pike, so I can gallop back to the office. At the school a few boys are walking and running on the track already, maybe part of some summer remedial-fitness program. The gate on this side of the field is chained shut and the gap is too narrow for me to squeeze through. So I proceed to the entrance on the east that I used yesterday. A 1:46 lap ensues, and it's back to work for me.
