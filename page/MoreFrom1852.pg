	<div class="old"><p>&lt; <strong class="changes">1852 is "my year": it's a century ahead of when I was born, and I continue to collect coins bearing that date. In addition to the tidbits gathered in</strong> [[<strong class="changes">NumisTriviaOf1852]] //(4 Jun 2000)// other historical events of that era offer evidence of scientific and societal progress in several dimensions. During 1852:<br />&lt; * In Boston, **Tufts University** is founded and **Emma Snodgrass** is arrested for wearing pants ...<br />&lt; * **Friedrich Heinrich Alexander** //(aka Baron von Humboldt)//, the German explorer and naturalist, receives the Copley Medal //(the first and highest award granted by the Royal Society of London)// ...<br />&lt; * The **American Pharmaceutical Association** is founded ...<br />&lt; * The first British **public toilet for women** opens in Bedford Street, London ...<br />&lt; * **Alice Pleasance Liddell** //(inspiration for "Alice in Wonderland")// is born, as is **Julius Richard Petri** //(inventor of the Petri dish)// and **Henri Becquerel** //(French physicist)// ...<br />&lt; * The first **Lone Star State Fair** is held in Corpus Christi, Texas ...<br />&lt; * **Susan B. Anthony** and **Elizabeth Cady Stanton** establish the Women's State Temperance Society of New York ...<br />&lt; * **Louis Braille** //(inventor of the Braille writing system for the blind)// dies, as does **Daniel Webster** //(American lawyer, orator, statesman, and Secretary of State)// ...<br />&lt; And perhaps of greatest significance, **Frederick Douglass**, abolitionist, is named Vice Presidential candidate of the Liberal Party. In Corinthian Hall //(Rochester, New York)// he gives the speech "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" which includes the passage:<br />&lt; :"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sound of rejoicing, empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shout of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanks-givings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy --- a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the Earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour."<br />&lt; //(for images of some coins in my 1852 collection see http://www.his.com/~z/</strong>1852<strong class="changes">.html = "1852!" and http://www.his.com/~z/gallery1852.html = "Gallery of 1852 Coins". )//<br />&lt; ----<br />&lt; [[TopicPersonalHistory</strong>]] <strong class="changes">- [[TopicScience]] - [[TopicSociety]] - Datetag20040310<br />&lt; ----<br />&lt; ----<br />&lt; //(correlates: [[NumisTriviaOf1852]], [[ProudSignage]], [[GoodNotation]], ...)//</strong></p></div><p><strong>to</strong></p>
