	"Polygamy Porter &mdash; bring some home to the wives!" says the slogan for a Utah brew. Nowhere-Man recalls the "Go West Beer Fest" that he attended with Ken and Emaad, and what happened afterwards. //(Trail Talk!)// We try to enhance today's trackfile with a loop, fall prey to a dead-end street with no cut-through escape, and have to backtrack. A realistic great blue heron sculpture stands guard in a front-yard garden. Ken and Win meet us in the tunnel under the train tracks. Two big deer amble across Rock Creek Trail.
	
	"Is that a gall?" - "Or a boll?" - "It looks like a giant brain!" We try to remember the term //("burl")// for a canker-like growth on the side of a tree. Win discusses plans for playful pranks and wonders about the potential benefits of electrical muscle stimulation for healing injuries. //("Just don't attach the wires to your head!")// Ken describes today's "Baldo" Sunday comic strip, with punchline "//**Libraries are theme parks for the mind!**//" Nowhere-Man's tie-dye-style skull shirt reads "Run or Die" with subscript "Singletrack Mind".
