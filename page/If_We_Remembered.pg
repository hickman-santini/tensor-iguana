text: | If we remembered it all,
	Every flare, flash, flicker,
	New images every moment:
	Would we overflow,
	Like a cup under a waterfall?
	Swell and stretch,
	Burst like a balloon,
	Slide into madness,
	Memories jostling, crowding,
	Erasing one another?
	If every stone were a diamond,
	Would they lose all value? |
