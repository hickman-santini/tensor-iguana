	following up on Robyn Dawes's article, "[[http://www.niaoren.info/pdf/Beauty/9.pdf|The Robust Beauty of Improper Linear Models in Decision Making]]" - hugely important reading! - consider a recommender system:
	
	* identify simple (input) criteria for each (output) decision
	* assign simple weights //(+1, 0, -1, whatever, but keep it **simple**)//
	* add up the weights selected for each decision
	* sort into descending order and recommend the top few!
	
	... a la **SAnTA** = "Structured Analytic Technique Advisor", the MITRE JavaScript browser-based "simplest recommender system that could possibly work" ... (^_^)
