	In contrast, a few major medical centers have begun to try something radically different and far more honorable:
	"""
	By promptly disclosing medical errors and offering earnest apologies and fair compensation, they hope to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and dilute anger that often fuels lawsuits.
	"""
	
	It seems to be working&mdash;the number of malpractice suits drops when hospitals try it, and patients and physicians are happier. 
	
	Hmmm ... wonder if the same principle could apply in other overly-litigatious arenas?
