	A heavy lunch of veggie burger, plus french fries and onion rings shared with a colleague&mdash;not the best pre-run fare! An hour later temps are in the low 50's but gusty north winds make it feel colder. From the office I jog out to the paved 1.1+ mile trail, run two laps, then return. At mile 1 see a medium-sized deer next to the asphalt. I make noise so as not to surprise her into a collision. Another deer stands by the trail a quarter mile later, and on my final lap a third has joined the first pair. They lift their heads and stare at me as I trot past.
