	Ken Swab is standing by his sporty new Mazda Miata convertible when I arrive at Dewey Park about 0735. I admire it and tease him about it. Then we head north from Rock Creek Trail milepost 8 to 9, swoop back to the junction with the [[http://www.montgomeryparks.org/PPSD/ParkTrails/trails_MAPS/matthew_henson_trail.shtm|Matthew Henson Trail]], and trot along it following Turkey Branch upstream. Ken turns back at milepost 11 on the MHT but I insist on doing the extra ~0.05 mile to touch my toe to the asphalt of Georgia Avenue. I have to race back to catch up with Ken, a sprint that gives me a 9:22 mile in the midst of our seven. Back at the start Ken insists on an extra mile. We continue southward to the faded half-mile line painted on the pavement, then return. Craig Roodenburg beeps at us as he pulls into Dewey Park to commence his run.
