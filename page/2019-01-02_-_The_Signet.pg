	"That stove!" - "Kitchen island!" - "Wine cooler!" - "Walk-in closets!" Dawn Patrol circumnavigates The Signet, a newly-built condo community in downtown McLean //("... from the $800s ..." for a one bedroom unit)//. We critique outdoor exercise machines //("Not **nearly** enough resistance!")// and assess a still-under-construction restaurant and gym. Christmas lights twinkle in trees for a few more days.
	
	"Snuggle-bugs!" K-Rex smiles, remembering the cuddly kittens that greet her when she arrives early. Roadkill rolls an already-sore right ankle as, replying to a text message, he steps off the edge of the asphalt. //Ouch!//
